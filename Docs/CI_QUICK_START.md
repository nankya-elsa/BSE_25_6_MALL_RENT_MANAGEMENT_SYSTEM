# CI Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What You Need to Know in 2 Minutes

### What is CI?

**Continuous Integration** = Automatic testing every time you push code to GitHub.

### Why Use It?

- ✅ Catch bugs before they reach production
- ✅ Keep code quality high across your team
- ✅ Prevent "it works on my machine" problems
- ✅ Safe collaboration with multiple developers

---

## 🚀 Your CI is Already Set Up!

You have TWO CI pipelines:

### 1. **ci-cd.yml** - Production Deployment

- Runs on `main` and `staging` branches
- Includes deployment to Render
- Has health checks

### 2. **ci.yml** - Development Testing (NEW)

- Runs on all branches and pull requests
- Quick feedback for developers
- Includes code quality checks

---

## 📋 What CI Does (The Phases)

### Every Time You Push Code:

```
1. Environment Setup      → Clean Ubuntu VM
2. Install Dependencies   → Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL
3. Backend Tests          → Django tests
4. Frontend Tests         → React/Jest tests
5. Build Application      → Production build
6. Report Results         → ✅ Pass or ❌ Fail
```

**Time: ~2-3 minutes**

---

## 🎬 How to Use CI

### Step 1: Write Your Code

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-payment-feature
# ... make your changes ...
```

### Step 2: Write Tests (Important!)

```python
# backend: shops/tests.py
def test_my_feature(self):
    # Your test here
    pass
```

```typescript
// frontend: MyComponent.test.tsx
test("my feature works", () => {
  // Your test here
});
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add payment feature"
git push origin feature/add-payment-feature
```

### Step 4: Watch CI Run

1. Go to GitHub → **Actions** tab
2. See your workflow running
3. Wait for ✅ green checkmark

### Step 5: Create Pull Request

```
✅ All checks passed
   • backend-tests (2m 15s)
   • frontend-tests (1m 30s)

Safe to merge! 🎉
```

---

## ✅ When Tests Pass

**You'll see:**

```
✅ backend-tests — Passed
✅ frontend-tests — Passed
✅ code-quality — Passed
```

**What to do:**

- ✅ Create pull request
- ✅ Request code review
- ✅ Merge when approved

---

## ❌ When Tests Fail

**You'll see:**

```
❌ backend-tests — Failed
   Error: test_payment_creation failed
   AssertionError: Expected 1000, got 500
```

**What to do:**

1. Click **"Details"** to see full error
2. Fix the issue in your code
3. Push the fix
4. CI runs automatically again
5. Repeat until ✅

---

## 🏆 Team Best Practices

### DO ✅

- **Always create feature branches**

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-name-feature-name
  ```

- **Wait for CI before merging**

  - Green checkmark = good to go
  - Red X = needs fixing

- **Write tests for new features**

  - Backend: Add to `tests.py`
  - Frontend: Create `*.test.tsx` files

- **Check CI results**
  - Review failures immediately
  - Don't ignore warnings

### DON'T ❌

- **Don't push directly to main**

  ```bash
  # ❌ NEVER DO THIS
  git checkout main
  git push
  ```

- **Don't merge failing tests**

  - Always fix failures first
  - Never use "override" without review

- **Don't skip writing tests**

  - Tests = safety net
  - No tests = bugs in production

- **Don't ignore CI**
  - If it fails, there's a reason
  - Investigate every failure

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Import Error: No module named X"

**Solution:** Add to `requirements.txt` or `package.json`

### Issue: "Database connection failed"

**Solution:** Check environment variables in CI workflow

### Issue: "Tests passed locally but fail in CI"

**Solution:**

- Check for hardcoded paths
- Verify environment variables
- Ensure consistent database data

### Issue: "Migration conflict detected"

**Solution:**

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
git add migrations/
git commit -m "Add missing migration"
git push
```

## 🎯 Quick Commands Reference

### Run Tests Locally (Before Pushing)

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
source ../venv/bin/activate
python manage.py test
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
npm run build
```

### Check CI Status

```bash
# View in browser
open https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions
```

### Fix Failed Tests

```bash
# See what failed in CI
# Fix the code
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Resolve failing tests"
git push  # CI runs automatically
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test Locally First

Always run tests before pushing:

```bash
# Backend
python manage.py test

# Frontend
npm test
npm run build
```

### Tip 2: Use Descriptive Commit Messages

```bash
# ❌ Bad
git commit -m "fix"

# ✅ Good
git commit -m "fix: Resolve payment calculation error in Shop model"
```

### Tip 3: Check CI Early

Don't wait hours to check if CI passed. Check within 5 minutes of pushing.

### Tip 4: Learn from Failures

Every CI failure is a learning opportunity. Read the logs carefully.

## 🚨 Emergency: CI is Broken

If CI completely fails to run:

1. **Check GitHub Status**: https://www.githubstatus.com/
2. **Check workflow syntax**: Use a YAML validator
3. **Check quotas**: GitHub Actions has usage limits
4. **Ask for help**: Share the error with your team

---

## 🎉 You're Ready!

**Your CI is configured and ready to use!**

### Next Steps:

1. ✅ Push some code
2. ✅ Watch CI run (GitHub → Actions tab)
3. ✅ See the green checkmark
4. ✅ Create a pull request
5. ✅ Celebrate! 🎊
