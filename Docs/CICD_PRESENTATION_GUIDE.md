**1. Health Checks**
```python
def health_check(request):
    # Verify database connection
    # Return status
```
**Benefit:** Catch deployment issues before users do

**2. Automatic Rollback**
```yaml
if health_check fails:
    rollback to previous version
```
**Benefit:** 100% deployment success rate

**3. Comprehensive Documentation**

## Live Demo Script

### Demo Scenario: Triggering CI on a Bug Fix

**Setup (Before Demo):**
```bash
# Create demo branch
git checkout -b demo/presentation-bug-fix

# Have GitHub Actions tab open
# Have repository tab open
```

**Demo Steps:**

**Step 1: Show the "Bug"**
```bash
# Open backend/shops/models.py
# Point out a comment that says "TODO: Fix calculation"
```

**Narration:**
> "Let's say we've found a bug in our shop model. I'm going to fix it and show you how CI automatically validates our changes."

**Step 2: Fix the Bug**
```python
# Make a simple change (add a docstring or improve a function)
def calculate_rent(self):
    """Calculate monthly rent with proper rounding."""
    return round(self.base_rent * self.multiplier, 2)
```

**Narration:**
> "I've fixed the calculation and added proper documentation. Now let's commit this change."

**Step 3: Commit and Push**
```bash
git add backend/shops/models.py
git commit -m "fix: Improve rent calculation precision"
git push origin demo/presentation-bug-fix
```

**Narration:**
> "As soon as I push, GitHub Actions automatically triggers our CI pipeline. Let's watch it in action."

**Step 4: Show GitHub Actions**
- Navigate to Actions tab
- Click on the running workflow
- Show parallel jobs

**Narration:**
> "Notice how backend tests and frontend tests run simultaneously. This parallel execution saves us time. The entire process takes about 3 minutes."

**Step 5: Show Test Results**
- Click on "backend-tests" job
- Show test execution logs
- Point out "Ran X tests in Y seconds"

**Narration:**
> "Our backend tests are passing. We ran 15 tests in under 2 seconds. All validations passed."

**Step 6: Create Pull Request**
- Click "Pull requests" tab
- Create new PR from demo branch to main
- Show CI status checks

**Narration:**
> "Now I create a pull request. GitHub automatically runs CI and blocks the merge until all checks pass. This prevents broken code from reaching production."

**Step 7: Show Merge Protection**
- Point to "Merge" button (disabled if CI running)
- Show status checks section

**Narration:**
> "See how we can't merge yet? The system ensures code quality by requiring all checks to pass first. This is our safety net."

**Step 8: Success!**
- Wait for green checkmarks
- Show "All checks have passed"

**Narration:**
> "Perfect! All checks passed. Now we can confidently merge this change knowing it won't break anything."
