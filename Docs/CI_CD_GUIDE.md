# CI/CD Guide - Mall Rent Management System

## What is CI/CD?

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Automatically tests and validates your code every time you push changes to GitHub. Think of it as an automated quality checker that ensures:

- Your code builds successfully
- All tests pass
- No breaking changes are introduced
- Team members' code integrates smoothly

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

Automatically deploys your application to production when tests pass. (Not yet configured for this project)

## How Does CI Work for This Project?

### The Workflow

```
Developer pushes code to GitHub
         ‚Üì
GitHub Actions triggers CI pipeline
         ‚Üì
Creates fresh Ubuntu environment
         ‚Üì
Runs Backend Tests (Django) in parallel with Frontend Tests (React)
         ‚Üì
If all pass ‚Üí ‚úÖ Code is safe to merge
If any fail ‚Üí ‚ùå Developer gets notified to fix issues
```

## CI Pipeline Phases

### **Backend Pipeline** (Django + PostgreSQL)

| Phase                       | What Happens                           | Why It Matters                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1. **Checkout**             | Downloads your code                    | Gets latest changes              |
| 2. **Setup Python**         | Installs Python 3.11                   | Ensures consistent environment   |
| 3. **Install Dependencies** | Runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` | Gets Django, DRF, psycopg2, etc. |
| 4. **Setup PostgreSQL**     | Creates test database                  | Mimics production database       |
| 5. **Create .env**          | Sets environment variables             | Database credentials for testing |
| 6. **Run Migrations**       | `python manage.py migrate`             | Creates database tables          |
| 7. **Run Tests**            | `python manage.py test`                | Executes all unit tests          |
| 8. **Check Migrations**     | Ensures no uncommitted migrations      | Prevents migration issues        |

### **Frontend Pipeline** (React + Vite + TypeScript)

| Phase                       | What Happens        | Why It Matters                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1. **Checkout**             | Downloads your code | Gets latest changes              |
| 2. **Setup Node.js**        | Installs Node.js 20 | JavaScript runtime               |
| 3. **Install Dependencies** | Runs `npm ci`       | Gets React, Vite, Tailwind, etc. |
| 4. **Type Check**           | `npx tsc --noEmit`  | Catches TypeScript errors        |
| 5. **Run Tests**            | `npm test`          | Executes Jest tests              |
| 6. **Build**                | `npm run build`     | Ensures production build works   |

### **Code Quality Pipeline** (Optional)

| Phase                 | What Happens | Why It Matters           |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1. **Python Linting** | Runs flake8  | Checks Python code style |

---

## When Does CI Run?

The CI pipeline automatically triggers when:

1. **You push code** to `main` or `develop` branches
2. **You create a Pull Request** targeting `main` or `develop`
3. **You push updates** to an existing Pull Request

---

## How to Read CI Results

### On GitHub:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **"Actions"** tab
3. You'll see a list of CI runs:
   - ‚úÖ **Green checkmark** = All tests passed
   - ‚ùå **Red X** = Something failed
   - üü° **Yellow dot** = Currently running

### Understanding Failures:

Click on a failed run to see:

- Which job failed (backend/frontend/code-quality)
- Which specific step failed
- Error logs to help debug

---

## First Time Setup

### What You Need to Do:

**Nothing!** The CI is already configured. Just push your code to GitHub and it will run automatically.

### What GitHub Does Automatically:

1. Detects the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file
2. Sets up the CI pipeline
3. Runs tests on every push/PR

---

## Best Practices for Your Team

### 1. **Never Push Directly to Main**

```bash
# ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS
git checkout main
git add .
git commit -m "changes"
git push

# ‚úÖ DO THIS INSTEAD
git checkout -b feature/your-name-feature-name
git add .
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push origin feature/your-name-feature-name
# Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

### 2. **Wait for CI Before Merging**

- Always wait for the green checkmark ‚úÖ
- Review any failures and fix them
- Never merge if tests are failing

### 3. **Write Tests for New Features**

```python
# backend: Add tests in shops/tests.py or user_accounts/tests.py
from django.test import TestCase

class ShopTestCase(TestCase):
    def test_create_shop(self):
        # Your test here
        pass
```

```typescript
// frontend: Add tests next to your components
describe("Dashboard", () => {
  it("should render correctly", () => {
    // Your test here
  });
});
```

### 4. **Keep CI Fast**

- Write focused, fast tests
- Don't test external APIs (use mocks)
- Avoid long-running tests

## Common CI Errors and Solutions

### Backend Errors:

| Error                              | Cause                      | Solution                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `ImportError: No module named 'X'` | Missing dependency         | Add to `requirements.txt`       |
| `django.db.utils.OperationalError` | Database connection failed | Check `.env` settings in CI     |
| `Tests failed`                     | Code broke existing tests  | Fix the failing tests           |
| `Migration conflict`               | Uncommitted migrations     | Run `makemigrations` and commit |

### Frontend Errors:

| Error              | Cause                    | Solution                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `Module not found` | Missing dependency       | Add to `package.json`    |
| `Type error`       | TypeScript type mismatch | Fix type definitions     |
| `Build failed`     | Syntax or import error   | Check Vite build locally |
| `Test failed`      | Component test broke     | Update or fix the test   |

---

## Local Testing (Before Pushing)

### Backend:

```bash
cd backend
source ../venv/bin/activate
python manage.py test
```

### Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
npm run build
```

---

## Viewing CI Status in Pull Requests

When you create a PR, GitHub will show:

```
‚úÖ All checks have passed
   ‚Ä¢ backend-tests ‚Äî 2m 34s
   ‚Ä¢ frontend-tests ‚Äî 1m 12s
   ‚Ä¢ code-quality ‚Äî 45s

Ready to merge!
```

Or if failed:

```
‚ùå Some checks were not successful
   ‚Ä¢ backend-tests ‚Äî Failed after 1m 23s
   ‚Ä¢ frontend-tests ‚Äî Passed
   ‚Ä¢ code-quality ‚Äî Passed

View details to see what went wrong
```

---

## CI Workflow File Location

The CI configuration is stored at:

```
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

You can edit this file to:

- Add more tests
- Add deployment steps
- Change when CI runs
- Add notifications

---

## Future Enhancements

Things we can add to the CI pipeline:

1. **Code Coverage Reports** - See what % of code is tested
2. **Security Scanning** - Check for vulnerabilities
3. **Performance Tests** - Ensure app runs fast
4. **Automatic Deployment** - Deploy to staging/production
5. **Slack/Email Notifications** - Get alerts on failures
6. **Database Seeding** - Test with realistic data

---

## Questions?

- Check the **Actions** tab on GitHub for run history
- Click on failed runs to see detailed logs
- Ask team members if you're stuck
- Review Django and Jest documentation for test writing

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **CI is now active** on your repository  
‚úÖ **Runs automatically** on every push and PR  
‚úÖ **Tests both backend and frontend** in parallel  
‚úÖ **Catches issues early** before they reach production  
‚úÖ **Improves code quality** across the team

**Remember:** Green checkmarks mean happy deployments! üöÄ
